            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Greetings fellow guest!</p>
            <p>This website was based on hnhx's site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230322101918/https://femboy.hu/">femboy.hu</a>, it was made in honor of them, sadly, hnhx commited suicide and they were the one who inspired me to use free software and GNU/Linux. I decided to do this in their "memorial".</p>
            <p>About me: Hey! I'm Kryx! A student from Spain, who likes old tech, music ($uicideboy$, Haunted Mound, Drain Gang...), programming , Nintendo , Vintage Apple and everything related to GNU/Linux and free software.</p>
