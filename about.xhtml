            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Greetings fellow guest!</p>
            <p>This website was based on hnhx's site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230322101918/https://femboy.hu/">femboy.hu</a>, it was made in honor of them, sadly, hnhx abandoned the internet and they were the one who inspired me to use free software and GNU/Linux. I decided to do this in their "memorial".</p>
            <p>About me: Hey! I'm Kryx! A self-claimed programmer from Spain, i like many things, programming, music, weapons... and everything related to GNU/Linux and free software. My only dream/life goal at the moment is to get out of Spain and move to a better country.</p>
            <p>if you want to contact me you can do it through Discord : @Kryxx42 or : Madrid@cumallover.me (yes , that is an email)</p>
