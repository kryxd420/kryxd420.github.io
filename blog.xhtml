            <h1>2023-11-13 LibreX is no longer worth using.</h1>
            <p>Hi! as many of you will know, sadly hnhx committed suicide this summer ,with that , all their proyects have been abandoned along with their YouTube Channel getting deleted, LibreX is not being supported,and because of that it no longer works well.</p>
            <p>I will love to take the proyect and be me the one who update it but i know i will not have enought time, for now on i will recommend using SearNGX.</p>
            <p>Someday i will be able to take the proyect but i dont know when.</p>
